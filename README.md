# CSC3310 - Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures

## Overview

This repository contains lab work for the **CSC3310 - Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures** course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (Fall 2024), instructed by Dr. Sebastian Berisha. The focus of the course is on algorithm design, data structures, and computational complexity.

## Learning Outcomes

This was provided by the course syllabus:

- Determine and justify time and space complexity of a variety of algorithms (both recursive and non-recursive)
- Identify differences between best, expected, and worst-case runtimes
- Identify and apply strategies such as brute force, greedy, recursive backtracking, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming in algorithm analysis and design
- Describe, implement, analyze, and apply data structures such as self-balancing trees and heaps
- Demonstrate applications of graph algorithms including breadth-first search, depth-first search, and topological sort
- Describe applications, tradeoffs, and requirements for appropriate use of cryptographic and hash-based algorithms
- Identify NP-complete problems
- Execute empirical methods for analyzing and comparing data structures and algorithms

## Repository Structure

The labs are organized into separate folders, each containing the source code and supporting files for the respective lab assignments:

```shell
├── Lab1/   # Benchmarking Insertion and Selection Sort
├── Lab2/   # Benchmarking Heaps
├── Lab3/   # Iterative Algorithm Design
├── Lab4/   # Selection Problem
└── Lab5/   # Scapegoat Trees
```
