\section{Approach}
% A paragraph describing the approach that you used to solve the problem. Provide at least 2 illustrations that explain the approach

\section{Pseudocode}
% High-level pseudocode for an algorithm that uses that rule to solve the computational problem for any input

\section{Algorithm Justification}
% 3. Provide an explanation and justification for why your algorithm is correct (1-3 paragraphs)



\section{Test Cases}
% A table of your test cases, the answers you expect, and the answers returned by running your implementation of the algorithm

\section{Recurrance Relation}
% Derive a recurrence relation describing the run time in terms of the number of points n. (Hint: assume that the random pivot divides the elements in half each time.
% Solve the recurrence relation to get a run time in terms of n in asymptotic notation

\section{Benchmarking}
% Benchmark your implementation versus an approach that sorts the numbers and picks the element at index k â€“ 1. You should include a table and graph from benchmarking different lists with different sizes of numbers. The benchmarks should support your theoretically-derived run time and provide evidence that the run time of your algorithm grows more slowly than the sorting approach.

\end{multicols*}

% add appendix
% 7. Attach all your source code and test cases in an appendix.
