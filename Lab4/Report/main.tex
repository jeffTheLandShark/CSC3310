\section{Approach}
% A paragraph describing the approach that you used to solve the problem. Provide at least 2 illustrations that explain the approach

\section{Pseudocode}
% High-level pseudocode for an algorithm that uses that rule to solve the computational problem for any input

\section{Algorithm Justification}
% 3. Provide an explanation and justification for why your algorithm is correct (1-3 paragraphs)



\section{Test Cases}
% A table of your test cases, the answers you expect, and the answers returned by running your implementation of the algorithm
\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Test & Description & Result \\
    \hline
    Test 1 & Test 10 elements to ensure that the kth smallest element corresponds to the [k-1]th index of a sorted list & Pass \\
    Test 2 & Test to ensure that lots of duplicate elements are handled correctly & Pass \\
    Test 3 & Test wildly small and large values & Pass \\
    Test 4 & Shuffle list and test, ensuring that there isn't a dependence on ordering & Pass \\
    Test 5 & 2 element list & Pass \\
    Test 6 & 10000 element list & Pass \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Test Results}
    \label{table:test_results}
\end{table}

\section{Recurrance Relation}
% Derive a recurrence relation describing the run time in terms of the number of points n. (Hint: assume that the random pivot divides the elements in half each time.
% Solve the recurrence relation to get a run time in terms of n in asymptotic notation

\section{Benchmarking}
% Benchmark your implementation versus an approach that sorts the numbers and picks the element at index k â€“ 1. You should include a table and graph from benchmarking different lists with different sizes of numbers. The benchmarks should support your theoretically-derived run time and provide evidence that the run time of your algorithm grows more slowly than the sorting approach.

% add appendix
% 7. Attach all your source code and test cases in an appendix.
